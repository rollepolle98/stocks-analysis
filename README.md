# stocks-analysis

## Overview of the Project

In this project the task was to initially create a workbook for the client,Steve. Steve was tasked with helping his parents analyze different types of green energy stock. The information that we start with is that Steve's parents invested in DACO New Energy Corporation (DQ). We are tasked with helping Steve look into DQ abd comparing the stock data to other similar companies. Initally we started with finding the Total Daily Volume (TDV) and Yearly return percentage for DQ in order to analyze the stocks trading frequency along with value from the beggining to end of the year. After Further analyzation, it became clear that DQ may not be the best option so we started doing the same for all other green energy stocks we were provided with. Once we accumulated all of this information we were able to create a workbook that included a flexible macro which allowed steve look at data sets for different years. Now that we created a workbook for steve to analyze the current data at hand, we then went onto refactoring the script in order to make it more applicable for future and larger data sets.

The main purpose of refactoring the script is to determine whether or not it succesfully made the VBA script faster than it did intially. Looking below at the visuals, we can further analyze whether we were succesful or not.
